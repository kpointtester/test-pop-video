    <h1>Sikkim Flash Floods Live Updates: 14 killed, 102 missing; PM Modi takes stock of situation    </h1>
    <p>
    North Sikkim Flash Floods Live Updates, October 5: At least 14 people have been killed and 102 are missing following flash floods triggered by a lake outburst in north Sikkim, PTI reported. As many as 2,011 people have been rescued since disaster struck early Wednesday, the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority (SSDMA) said. Rescue operations are underway. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took stock of the situation on Wednesday night, assuring all possible support to the chief minister.

What happened? A glacial lake situated in the state’s northwest at 17,000 ft — burst due to incessant rains, leading to the release of water in downstream areas. This caused the rise of water levels in Teesta river that flooded at least four districts, including Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong and Namchi on Wednesday (October 4), according to Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority (SSDMA). The flood in Sikkim that started around 1.30 am was made worse by the release of water from Chungthang dam, officials told PTI.  Central Water Commission (CWC), in a post on X, suggested that the lake burst could have been caused by the earthquake in Nepal on Tuesday, but did not elaborate.

Among those missing are 22 Army soldiers — one was rescued on Wednesday night. All schools located in Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong and Namchi districts will remain closed till October 8, the education department said in a circular. Meanwhile, the flash floods affecting northern parts of West Bengal that share a border with Sikkim,  Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Wednesday said that 10,000 people have been rescued. The Governor is expected to visit the affected areas today.
